## Features

- User-friendly interface for answering personality assessment questions.
- Data visualization using Chart.js to display personality traits.
- Backend processing of user responses to generate personality insights.
- Integration with two K-means clustering models stored in the `models` directory for personality analysis.

## Files and Folders

- **app.py**: Flask application file that defines routes and handles user interactions.
- **Test.py**: Python script containing functions for generating personality charts based on user responses.
- **questions.csv**: CSV file containing the questions for the personality assessment.
- **css/**: Folder containing CSS files for styling the web interface.
